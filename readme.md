#Description
Create a sort algorithm that sorts the array by its value while treating the order of the keys as important, and thereby maintaining them in their relative order where their values are matching.

###Example:
Given the array:
 
```
$B[10]=7
$B[9]=7
$B[17]=6
$B[11]=6
$B[23]=3
$B[27]=4
```
After the sort is run, your array would be ordered by key in the above example as `23,27,17,11,10,9`


#Usage
1) replace $example by any array you want
2) open it in browser
3) output will be ordered array
